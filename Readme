Hello and welcome to my creating data products submital.
Please find the r code for the server and ui.
The app is based around a conversation I had regarding process improvement.
It surprised me that when a process had a small chance of failure even a relatively large improvement
(say 20 % reduction in failure rate) was difficult to detect.

Additionally the R mark down file for the presentation should be included.
I'm not entirely happy with this file but have run out of time.
I tried to insert images but once uploaded they did not work.
I am unhappy with how the shiny widgets are rendered (last slide).

This work was based on course notes and the r studio website below
