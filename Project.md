For Process Change

Why use this App?
========================================================


This app assists with discussion around process change.
It is designed to promote understanding of statistical concepts by allowing participants to interact with

- Probabilities
- Batch Size
- Confidence intervals

And visualise the effect on the probability distribution caused by these changes.

[Really cool App](https://anarub.shinyapps.io/Trial1) 

Traditional mathmatical methods for decision making can be a bit like Witchcraft.
========================================================

Below is an equation that provides a sample size needed to assess if p really is 0.025. It has error terms, confidence interval and even zstars, what ever they are.

Who really understands this stuff?


```r
zstar=qnorm(.975);p=0.025;E=0.005
output<-round(zstar^2 * p *(1 - p)/E^2,-2)
```
All the CEO sees, is that you want to have a trial, involving around 3700 units at $100 each.
